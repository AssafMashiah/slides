# Research Brief: Iran's Missile Arsenal

## Overview

Iran possesses the largest and most diverse missile arsenal in the Middle East — thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles developed over four decades of indigenous weapons programs. Banned from purchasing advanced weapons systems after the 1979 revolution, Iran built its own. Today the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force (IRGC-ASF) oversees a program capable of striking as far as Israel and southeastern Europe. Iran is also the region's primary missile proliferator, arming Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Iraqi militias with rockets and guidance technology.

## Categories of Iranian Missiles

### 1. Short-Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBM) — Up to 1,000 km

These form the backbone of Iran's battlefield deterrent. Derived from Soviet Scud technology, many have been indigenously upgraded.

- **Shahab-1**: Range 285–330 km. Based on Soviet Scud-B. Operational since the 1980s. Iran's first ballistic missile capability; used in the Iran-Iraq War.
- **Shahab-2**: Range 500 km. Based on Scud-C. Extended range over Shahab-1. Operational.
- **Fateh-110**: Range 200–300 km. Iran's first fully indigenous solid-fuel missile. Highly accurate; used in multiple combat operations. Operational.
- **Fateh-313**: Range 500 km. Advanced variant of Fateh-110 with improved precision and range. Operational.
- **Fateh-110D / Zolfaghar**: Range 700 km. Extended Fateh family member with maneuverable warhead. Used in January 2020 strikes on US bases at Ain al-Assad. Operational.
- **Qiam-1**: Range 700–800 km. Liquid-fuel, no stabilizing fins — harder to track on radar. Used in multiple attacks. Operational.
- **Tondar-69**: Range ~150 km. Based on Chinese CSS-8. Short-range battlefield system. Operational.
- **Koksan M1978**: Range 40–60 km. Long-range artillery piece (not a guided missile). North Korean-derived. Operational.

### 2. Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBM) — 1,000–3,000 km

Iran's strategic deterrent. These can reach Israel, US bases throughout the Middle East, and parts of Europe.

- **Shahab-3**: Range 1,300 km. Based on North Korean Nodong-1. Iran's first MRBM. Can reach Israel. Operational.
- **Ghadr-1 (Shahab-3 variant)**: Range 1,950 km. Upgraded Shahab-3 with improved fuel and re-entry vehicle. In Development/operational.
- **Emad (Shahab-3 variant)**: Range 1,700 km. Maneuverable re-entry vehicle — significantly harder to intercept. In Development.
- **Sejjil**: Range 2,000 km. Iran's most advanced MRBM — two-stage, solid-fuel. Can be launched faster than liquid-fuel missiles (no fueling time). Operational.
- **Khorramshahr**: Range 2,000 km. Multiple independently targetable warheads (MaRV capable). In Development.

### 3. Cruise Missiles

Slower than ballistic missiles but fly low, evading radar. Harder to intercept.

- **Soumar**: Range 2,000–3,000 km. Iran's longest-range cruise missile. Derived from Soviet Kh-55 cruise missile. Can reach deep into Europe. Operational (presumed).
- **Ya-Ali**: Range 700 km. Land-attack cruise missile with terrain-following guidance. Operational.
- **Hoveizeh**: Range 1,350 km. Upgraded Soumar variant. Unveiled 2019. Used in September 2019 Aramco attacks. Operational.
- **Ra'ad**: Range 350 km. Anti-ship cruise missile. Operational.

### 4. Anti-Ship Missiles

Designed to deny US carrier groups access to the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz.

- **Ra'ad**: Range 350 km. Anti-ship cruise missile. Based on Chinese C-802. Operational.
- **Noor**: Range ~170 km. Anti-ship cruise missile. Hezbollah used a Noor variant to strike INS Hanit (Israeli warship) during the 2006 Lebanon War.
- **Khalij Fars**: Ballistic anti-ship missile — rare capability. Designed to hit moving aircraft carriers. Range ~300 km. Operational.
- **Hormuz-1/2**: Anti-radiation missile designed to destroy radar systems on ships or ground. Range 300 km.

### 5. Space Launch Vehicles (Dual-Use)

Iran's space program uses technology directly applicable to long-range ballistic missiles.

- **Safir**: Iran's first SLV. Placed a satellite in orbit in 2009. Range/altitude ~350 km. Operational.
- **Simorgh**: Two-stage SLV. Can carry heavier payloads — and theoretically heavier warheads. In Development.
- **Qaem-100**: Solid-fuel SLV. Unveiled 2022. Significant: solid-fuel ICBMs are the hardest to counter (fast launch). Operational.

## Iran's Missile Doctrine

Iran's missile program serves four strategic functions:

1. **Deterrence**: The threat of massive retaliation against Israel, US bases, and Gulf states deters conventional attack.
2. **Power Projection**: Missiles give Iran reach far beyond its conventional military's ability to project force.
3. **Proxy Arming**: Iran transfers missiles and production technology to Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, and Iraqi militias — creating a distributed deterrent.
4. **Nuclear Delivery**: Should Iran complete a nuclear device, its Shahab-3/Sejjil/Khorramshahr family provides delivery vehicles. In October 2025, Supreme Leader Khamenei authorized development of miniaturized nuclear warheads.

## Notable Combat Uses

- **Iran-Iraq War (1980–1988)**: Iran and Iraq exchanged Scud attacks on cities — the "War of the Cities." Iran fired hundreds of Scud-B variants at Baghdad.
- **June 2017**: Iran fired six ballistic missiles at ISIS positions in Syria — its first active combat use in decades. A political signal as much as a military strike.
- **September 2018**: Seven Fateh-110 missiles struck Kurdish opposition headquarters in Koya, Iraq.
- **September 2019**: Cruise missiles and drones struck Saudi Aramco facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily halting 5–7% of global oil production.
- **January 8, 2020**: Iran fired 16 ballistic missiles (Qiam-1 and Fateh-313) at US bases Ain al-Assad and Erbil in retaliation for Soleimani's assassination. Over 100 US troops suffered traumatic brain injuries.
- **April 2024**: Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles directly at Israel — its first ever direct attack on Israeli territory. The vast majority were intercepted by Israel, the US, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.
- **October 2024**: Iran launched ~200 ballistic missiles at Israel in a second wave. Several reached Israeli territory; Iron Dome and Arrow 3 intercepted most.

## Proliferation: Iran's Missile Exports

Iran is the region's primary missile proliferator:

- **Hezbollah (Lebanon)**: Estimated 150,000+ rockets and missiles, including Fateh-110, Zelzal, Fajr-5. Hezbollah's arsenal is larger than most Middle Eastern militaries.
- **Hamas (Gaza)**: Shorter-range rockets (Qassam, M-75, J-80) with Iranian technology. Iranian-supplied Fajr-5 rockets reached Tel Aviv in 2012.
- **Houthis (Yemen)**: Ballistic missiles (Burkan-2H, range ~1,000 km), cruise missiles, and drones. Used to attack Riyadh airport (2017), Saudi oil facilities (2019), Dubai (2022), and Israel (2023–2024).
- **Iraqi Militias**: Katyusha rockets and guided missiles for attacks on US bases.
