# ⚔️ Iran War: What Changes for Your Portfolio?

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-8 text-left">

<div class="bg-red-900 bg-opacity-50 p-4 rounded-lg">

### 🔴 Short-term Risk
**NVDA** — sentiment selloff + Taiwan supply chain concern

High vol Friday (310M shares) signals nervousness

</div>

<div class="bg-yellow-900 bg-opacity-50 p-4 rounded-lg">

### 🟡 Neutral
**NET, MSFT, AMZN** — pure software & cloud

Fundamentals unaffected. May dip with market, not because of war.

</div>

<div class="bg-green-900 bg-opacity-50 p-4 rounded-lg">

### 🟢 Opportunity
**PLTR** — defense AI is a direct beneficiary

Military AI contracts accelerate in conflict environments.

</div>

<div class="mt-8 text-xl font-bold text-green-400">
💡 Geopolitical dips in quality tech = buying opportunities, not exits

# 🆕 New Position #1: AMD

**Advanced Micro Devices — $AMD**

### Why it fits your thesis
- Only credible alternative to NVDA in AI GPUs
- MI300X chips gaining hyperscaler traction
- Every cloud provider wants GPU diversification

### AI-Era Potential
- AI inference at scale → AMD's sweet spot
- Priced at significant discount to NVDA

::right::

<br><br>

### Leadership Potential ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Lisa Su has delivered consistently. Roadmap solid.

### Risk
- CUDA moat — NVDA's software lock-in is real
- Execution risk on AI software stack

### Verdict
> **Strong buy on dips.** Core infrastructure play. Start small, add on weakness.

# 🆕 New Position #2: ORCL

**Oracle — $ORCL**

### Why it fits your thesis
- OCI growing 40%+ YoY — hyperscalers diversifying
- Signed massive AI training contracts with model labs
- Database lock-in = sticky, recurring revenue

### AI-Era Potential
- AI training workloads are migrating to OCI
- Unique: database dominance + cloud + AI pipeline

::right::

<br><br>

### Leadership Potential ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Underappreciated. The boring backbone everyone needs.

### Risk
- Older company culture, slower iteration
- Larry Ellison concentration risk

### Verdict
> **Underappreciated AI infrastructure play.** Less hype, more substance. Good entry point now.

# 🆕 New Position #3: CRWD

**CrowdStrike — $CRWD**

### Why it fits your thesis
- Every AI deployment expands the attack surface
- Falcon platform is AI-native, real-time threat detection
- War context = state-sponsored cyber attacks accelerating

### AI-Era Potential
- More AI = more attack surface = more CRWD revenue
- They use AI to build their product. Virtuous cycle.

::right::

<br><br>

### Leadership Potential ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
#1 or #2 in every endpoint security category. Platform expanding (identity, cloud, SIEM).

### Risk
- High valuation
- July 2024 outage memory — some enterprise trust still rebuilding

### Verdict
> **Best security play in the AI era.** Defensive infrastructure angle. Missing from your current mix.

# 💰 DCA Strategy — $1,000/month

**Suggested allocation given current market conditions:**

| Allocation | Ticker | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 30% → $300 | **VOO** | Always. Market baseline. |
| 25% → $250 | **NVDA** | Buy the war dip. |
| 20% → $200 | **PLTR** | Defense AI tailwind. |
| 15% → $150 | **AMD or CRWD** | Start one new position. |
| 10% → $100 | **NET or MSFT** | Rotate in. |

> **If Iran situation escalates Monday:** Lean heavier into PLTR and CRWD. Both benefit from conflict.
