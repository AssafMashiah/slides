# The Boxer Engine

The heart of every Subaru — pistons punch outward horizontally instead of up-and-down.

- **Lower center of gravity** — better handling
- **Less vibration** — smoother operation
- **Signature rumble** — the unequal-length header sound

# Symmetrical AWD

- Power split equally to all four wheels
- Drivetrain sits in a straight line — perfectly balanced
- Three AWD systems: Active Torque Split, VTD, DCCD (STI)
- Works in rain, snow, gravel — confidence in any condition
